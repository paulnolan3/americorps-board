"The Landing Place - Rockland, Maine","The Landing Place opened in 2017 with the primary goal of providing comprehensive, compassionate, and community-minded support to youth and families living in Midcoast Maine. We do this through a comprehensive model of support built around a low barrier drop-in center, youth case management services, shelter solutions for teenagers and young adults, and extensive and intentional community outreach and collaboration throughout Midcoast Maine. The Landing Place is a story about courage and compassion. It is a story about teamwork and collaboration. The Landing Place is a story about offering hope and restoring dignity. It is about demonstrating what is possible when people treat each other with kindness and respect. The Landing Place is a story about the youth of Rockland, about statewide support and partnerships. The Landing Place is a story about community. Our motto is: You are here! In other words: We see you. We hear you. You are not alone, or invisible. You matter. Utilizing the power of intentional relationship building, TLP seeks to be a safe and accessible place for all youth of Midcoast Maine. Through our low barrier drop-in center, case management services, youth centric housing solutions and free therapy services we seek to develop authentic relationships and comprehensive care for youth and their families. With an emphasis on relationship building, staff aim to increase positive childhood experiences as a foil to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), interacting regularly with 75-100 youth a week. Our next big step to serve our youth and their families is the creation and implementation of a youth leadership program, engaging our older TLP youth in mentorship roles for their younger counterparts. Our AmeriCorps Fellow will help us envision, create, lead and evaluate this leadership program.
