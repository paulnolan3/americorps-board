Kids in Tech Media and Communications VISTA,"Kids in Tech, Inc’s (KIT’s) mission is to excite, educate, and empower children to acquire skills and confidence in technology through interactive after school programs. The existing STEM educational framework does few favors for low-income children, who statistically tend to live in urban or suburban settings and be ethnic minorities. Without targeted interventions that promote STEM education for low-income and BIPOC students, their interests and potential will remain untapped. After-school STEM programs have provided evidence that, even in specialized curriculum settings, children who qualify for lunch subsidies scored lower than their counterparts who did not qualify. Elementary and middle school aged children in these programs did see improvements to their outcomes, and under-privileged groups saw the greatest gains. After-school STEM programs have demonstrated a unique learning environment that enables group-centered and hands-on-learning that make demonstrable gains in knowledge acquisition.

KIT’s after school programs have been a vital supplemental opportunity for low-income youth in Lowell schools and housing authority for the past 6 years, and expanded to serve students in Boston in 2021. Performance in STEM areas for these groups remains low in Lowell, Boston, and nationally. Thus, it is critical that after school STEM programs are able to expand to meet the needs of as more students require support and time to provide remedial education. KIT’s VISTA project will seek to prepare KIT to serve more low-income, minority students in Massachusetts by increasing the organization’s fundraising, communications, curricula, fundraising, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and expects to benefit 300 youth aged 8 to 14 from schools where at least 50% of students qualify for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).

EMI VISTA Leader,"The EMI Egress Youth Diversion Program is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico and provides intervention and prevention services for pre-adjudicated and nonviolent adjudicated youth. Adjudication is the legal process where a judge determines if a juvenile has committed an offense. A pre-adjudication conference allows the juvenile, their attorney, and the prosecutor to discuss the case and explore alternatives before a court ruling. The EMI Egress Youth Diversion Program supports these youth by providing structured programs to meet court requirements, prevent further offenses, and promote positive decision-making. Prevention services are for students whose behavior, while not requiring court involvement, indicates a need for intervention. EMI partners with schools to offer an alternative for suspended students, reducing time out of the classroom while teaching essential life, social, and coping skills. This approach aims to prevent repeated suspensions and further justice system involvement. The EMI Egress Youth Diversion is the only agency in Bernalillo County offering specialized services tailored to prevent youth involvement in the justice system. The program also supports families, ensuring a broader impact on long-term stability and success.

Ohio Reading Corps will engage AmeriCorps members in Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton, and Youngstown (and surrounding areas) to provide reading and math instruction to children who are at-risk of failing to meet grade-level requirements. 

Each year, AmeriCorps provides funding to projects aimed at increasing academic achievement.

Each AmeriCorps member is required to participate in professional development training throughout their service. In addition, members must participate in National Days of Service by volunteering in the community.

Learn more: housingactionil.org/americorps.

Connections serves and catalyzes the community to end homelessness, one person at a time. We cannot fulfill that mission without more affordable housing. A key barrier to developing more affordable housing is resistance to it, often based on lack of knowledge and misinformation. Our advocacy program, Joining Forces for Affordable Housing, is expanding to provide community education across northern Cook County and Lake County. The Research Associate will create a repository of information for Connections to tailor educational activities to different towns based on demographics, housing solutions that could be beneficial, and level of knowledge. By using data to inform our educational activities, the VISTA will increase the number of people Connections can reach and the effectiveness with which we can educate and engage them on housing issues in their communities. 

Our ideal candidate is a good researcher and writer, with great curiosity and interest in urban planning. They would have a related degree, experience with accessing census data, and preferably experience doing original academic research and writing in related fields. Experience in communicating data to a wide audience would be a plus! This position offers a $500 monthly housing stipend.

Ohio Reading Corps will engage AmeriCorps members in Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton, and Youngstown (and surrounding areas) to provide reading and math instruction to children who are at-risk of failing to meet grade-level requirements. Each year, AmeriCorps provides funding to projects aimed at increasing academic achievement. However, the goals of AmeriCorps expand far beyond academics and include expanding economic opportunity and strengthening communities through civic engagement. 

Each AmeriCorps member is required to participate in professional development training throughout their service. In addition, members must participate in National Days of Service by volunteering in the community. Members will not engage in Prohibited Activities, as described in the Terms and Conditions, and in the member Service Agreement.

By addressing systemic challenges and increasing access to higher education, the program supports both individual and community transformation.

In addition, TMP provides virtual career panels that are available free to Washington students.  Student served by The Mentoring Project are enrolled on various Washington campuses and all meetings with mentors occur virtually, not at the campus or any other physical site. 

We rely on our community college partner institutions to refer students.   However, more tactical outreach is now required, such as a peer-recruit/referral network. Although most of our outreach is conducted electronically, we will visit some campuses to post flyers and table at events to inform students about mentorship opportunities.   

The community colleges are the postsecondary sector with the least resources, the largest population of low-income students and students of color, and the highest level of attrition. This project addresses the fact that only slightly more than half of students who begin a degree at one of the community or technical colleges in Washington state will graduate (53% in 2019; 54% in 2020; 57% in 2021). [Source: Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges]. The attrition rate is higher for historically underserved students of color who may have difficulty connecting to services and building or finding caring relationships on campus.

TMA Montgomery College Leaders in Learning,"Montgomery College’s Leaders in Learning initiative will expand economic and academic opportunities for students from low-income backgrounds by creating a sustainable paid student leadership program within the Achieving the Promise Academy (ATPA) and MC Learning Centers. This three-year project leverages Montgomery College’s commitment to student success, career readiness, and equitable access to resources. Through this initiative, students will gain valuable work experience, leadership development, and career-aligned skills by serving as peer academic coaches and tutors. The project addresses structural barriers to economic mobility by embedding paid leadership roles into the College’s academic support infrastructure. VISTA members will support the creation of these roles, develop and adapt student-focused training programs, and coordinate partnerships with local employers to integrate career exploration into peer academic coaching. By the end of the project, Montgomery College will institutionalize these roles, expand micro-credential offerings, and increase student retention, career readiness, and degree completion—especially in high-demand fields such as health care and skilled trades.

BMVP - Improving Health via Innovative Support Programs,"The mission of the Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Division (BHDD) is to implement and improve a statewide system of prevention, treatment, care, and rehabilitation for Montanans with mental disorders or addictions to drugs or alcohol. An estimated 80,000 Montanans struggle with substance use disorders across the state, and a rise in opioid and methamphetamine use is contributing to an even higher need for quality mental health care. According to the Montana Substance Use Disorder Task Force Strategic Plan, 92% of Montanans with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD) are not receiving treatment. Thirty-five percent of all drug overdose deaths are attributable to opioids. Montana has made progress in recent years addressing prescription opioid misuse and abuse and reducing overdose deaths, though much more can be done to ensure that opioids are prescribed, taken, and disposed of safely. People with access to adequate support for mental health issues can acquire and maintain employment, engage in education services, and lead productive lives. Additional benefits include decreasing mortality rates, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits due to drug overdoses.

BMVP - Foster Entrepreneurship for English Language Learners,"Lutheran Family Services Rocky Mountains (LFSRM) is rooted in values of kindness, dignity, and justice. LFSRM provides support, guidance, and resource coordination for Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) eligible populations, who receive benefits through the Department of Health and Human Services to support resettlement and integration. Refugees are highly motivated to contribute to the economy. In 2019, the United States boasted nearly 188,000 refugee entrepreneurs, who generated $5.1 billion in business income. However, refugees face steep barriers to entry for business ownership. Differences in language and socialization often make it difficult to take business classes or engage in marketing. LFSRM seeks to create English learning resources which fit with work schedules, expand availability of instruction in native tongues, bolster financial support via community engagement, and create opportunities for networking. According to the Urban Institute, an individual’s entrepreneurial spirit can either promote or inhibit their upward mobility. Clients will be better equipped to reinvest in the community and support neighborhood revitalization.

BMVP - Expanding Opportunities for Youth with Disabilities,"Eagle Mount's mission is to create meaningful experiences for people with disabilities through adaptive recreation. The agency provides a sense of belonging and lifelong friendships inspired by a spirit of adventure. Too few opportunities exist for youth and adults with disabilities to participate in community-integrated activities – recreationally and socially. In Yellowstone County, over six percent of youth have a disability. While Medicaid and Medicare typically ensure access to basic healthcare, many families that include a child with disabilities have no discretionary dollars. This cycle of poverty begins – or continues – with no discernable path to economic independence. People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty due to pervasive discrimination and a litany of structural barriers to economic security and upward mobility. The impacts include less access to health care, delayed cognitive development, and limited leisure opportunities. Additionally, they can experience increased stress and low self-esteem. As they advance through school, children with disabilities require additional academic, vocational, and social skill development. By providing low cost and stimulating recreational experiences for youth with disabilities, Eagle Mount creates opportunities for participants to engage with each other and the outdoors. Youth develop increased skills, self-esteem, social competencies, and friendships. In the long term, participants realize more fully developed physical and cognitive gains, academic gains, vocational skill development, decreased social isolation and enhanced self-sustainability. This project will alleviate poverty by increasing access to activities that will strengthen social, vocational, and cognitive competencies of youth with disabilities and improve academic engagement, thus ensuring a higher chance of success in educational achievement and future job prospects to break the cycle of poverty.

This listing is to fill the Host Site opening at the Charlottesville Redevelopment and Housing Authority (CRHA) in Charlottesville, VA. 

CRHA is a resident-centered organization committed to excellence in providing affordable quality housing, revitalizing communities, supporting resident involvement, and promoting upward mobility and self-sufficiency through partnerships in the public and private sector.

CRHA is looking for a detail-oriented individual to serve as the Economic Opportunity Specialist VISTA to help increase the effectiveness of the Economic Opportunity program by providing much-needed support in the standardization of operating procedures, collection and sharing of data (both quantitative and qualitative), consistent communication practices with partner organizations and residents, and the effective integration of “The Model for Improvement” in Resident Services programming.

TMA Fairmont State University: Pathways to Success,"Fairmont State University, through its Civics Institute, is launching a three-year AmeriCorps VISTA project to address barriers to post-secondary education and financial literacy among low-income high school students in West Virginia. The initiative aims to design and implement a sustainable, replicable model that increases college access and financial literacy, promoting long-term economic mobility for students in underserved communities.
By providing students with knowledge and tools to understand college affordability, financial aid, student loans, and career planning, the project aligns with AmeriCorps VISTA’s mission of poverty alleviation through capacity building. The initiative includes a comprehensive, multi-year curriculum and emphasizes community partnerships, stakeholder engagement, and educational innovation to ensure lasting impact.
Key goals include empowering students to navigate the college application process, increasing access to financial aid and scholarships, and fostering informed financial decision-making. The project will also focus on building financial literacy skills to support economic mobility and reduce poverty.
West Virginia continues to face challenges in educational attainment and financial stability. Only 24.1% of residents aged 25+ hold a bachelor’s degree, compared to 35% nationally (U.S. Census Bureau, 2021). Many low-income and rural students lack guidance on navigating higher education and managing finances. This VISTA project directly addresses these gaps by supporting a statewide effort to expand financial literacy and college access. By partnering with schools, community organizations, and higher education institutions, the VISTA member will help build a curriculum and model that can be sustained and scaled beyond the term of service.

Our mission is to create and support evidence-based intervention programs in math and language skills development for families of children in under-resourced communities.

Cayenne Wellness Center Community Engagement VISTA,"CWC's mission is to increase the quality of life for individuals diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD) in California by ensuring expert, unbiased, and comprehensive care. This mission is part of a broader vision of (1) a medical system which effectively addresses the unique needs of individuals with sickle cell disease and (2) patients who are empowered and equipped to advocate for themselves.

The Community Engagement VISTA will support CWC's mission to enhance the quality of life for individuals living with SCD across California. This VISTA position will drive volunteer recruitment, civic engagement, and advocacy efforts, particularly focused on underserved communities disproportionately affected by SCD.

The VISTA members will build and maintain sustainable volunteer engagement systems, manage a growing volunteer database, and recruit individuals from diverse backgrounds, including SCD warriors and caregivers. The VISTA will develop targeted outreach campaigns, form partnerships with corporate
and community organizations, and ensure that all volunteers are trained and supported in alignment with CWC's mission.

The Community Engagement VISTA will coordinate two major statewide advocacy events—The Policy Forum (National Advocacy Day) and The Capitol Visit (Statewide Advocacy Day)—to mobilize patients, caregivers, and community members to improved healthcare and equity in SCD care. Through careful planning and execution, these events will amplify the voices of those impacted by SCD and advocate for individuals with SCD. 

By organizing volunteer training programs (e.g., Sickle Cell 101) and improving demographic tracking and reporting, the VISTA member will leave behind strong infrastructure and systems to support future recruitment, community education, and civic engagement work.

TMA NDC- Community Design Project,"The TMA AmeriCorps VISTA project, “Building, Sharing, and Equalizing Power through Community Design” addresses the need for long-term capacity building among the community partners that the Neighborhood Design Center (NDC) engages with through our Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) sponsored work in low-to-moderate income communities in Baltimore City. NDC provides pro bono planning, capacity building, conceptual design, and community engagement services for community-initiated projects across Baltimore City. NDC's approach is to empower communities by utilizing design as a tool for autonomy, agency, and advocacy. We collaborate with community leaders committed to community development that is targeted and responsive to residents' needs and priorities, increasing the vitality of community spaces and the quality of public infrastructure investment and maintenance.

Healthy Learners Fall 2025,"Healthy Learners (HL) was founded in Columbia, South Carolina in 1992 as the first health ministry of the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine through Providence Hospital, when concerned community leaders realized that there were children in the community who suffered from unaddressed vision issues that were affecting their ability to succeed in school. Staff and supporters soon realized that there were far too many children in South Carolina who needed not only vision care, but other health care services that directly impacted success in school. So, HL stepped up to meet those needs, expanding its services and geographic reach over the past 32 years. Today, Healthy Learners partners with 230+ schools in 20 School Districts and more than 200 local health care providers throughout South Carolina to provide children who are in need and without resources with essential  health care services, including preventative ones. 
 
Healthy Learners is on a mission to transform the futures of children in poverty in South Carolina. Research has proven that education is the key for children to go further in life, empowering them to obtain higher-wage jobs, make positive life choices, and learn to invest in their future communities to make them stronger, healthier, and vibrant. For many children in poverty, their educational success is at risk because of fixable health care challenges that have not been addressed – known as health barriers to learning.  Healthy Learners was created to address these challenges head on and serve as the catalyst to ensure every child receives the health care they need to thrive in school.

25-26- HOPE Fair Housing Center- VISTA Housing Action Corps,"The Fair Housing VISTA will serve with HOPE Fair Housing Center in Wheaton, IL from August 2025-2026. HOPE Fair Housing Center (HOPE) is part of Housing Action Corps, an AmeriCorps VISTA program managed by Housing Action Illinois since 2010. Housing Action Corps members receive custom training, support, and networking opportunities in housing and community development, in addition to the traditional benefits of AmeriCorps VISTA. Learn more: housingactionil.org/americorps.

For 55+ years, HOPE has provided fair housing enforcement services to advocate, investigate, and take formal civil rights legal actions in support of Illinoisans whose freedom to choose and enjoy where they live has been obstructed by illegal housing discrimination. HOPE’s services reach thousands of individuals each year, across 40 Illinois counties. The Fair Housing VISTA will leave a lasting impact on Illinois’ oldest and largest fair housing agency and support victims of housing discrimination by enhancing fundraising efforts, streamlining grant management systems, and developing a framework and resources for HOPE’s first rental counseling program. This project will enhance HOPE’s capacity to fight housing discrimination and promote housing stability for some of the state’s most vulnerable renters, in particular through the launch of a new rental counseling program and identifying resources and strategies to expand our services in central and southern IL. 

Our ideal candidate is capable of engaging with diverse groups and working within a highly collaborative space, while also managing tasks independently and with proven time management skills. They should demonstrate strong organizational and innovative-thinking skills. The candidate does not need to be versed in housing and/or fair housing, but should be excited and open to learning about fair housing. This position offers a $500 monthly housing stipend.

Friends of the Cheat,"As a result of high poverty levels and the economic situation of our local schools, notably rural districts with dwindling tax bases, such as Preston and Tucker Counties, local youth have limited options and restricted access to summer learning opportunities. Further, there are even fewer options that utilize outdoor spaces and nature-based learning experiences to grow stewardship, confidence, and resiliency in our youth. Studies show that being in nature, and engaging in both structured and un-structured activities, helps children focus and concentrate, as well as helps lengthen their attention spans and thus prevents summer learning loss. Being outside in nature also helps children expend energy in a healthy environment, helping them to develop their senses and keeping their brain active and engaged instead of experiencing learning loss through more sedentary activities during the summer months. Participants will engage in age-appropriate activities during camp that will reinforce lessons learned throughout the school year in science, math, art, and technology, as it relates to the environment. Friends of the Cheat seeks to fill this void and serve our youth through engagement in community events, summer camps, stand-alone workshops and lessons, as well as the development of environmental education-focused activity kits and additional educational materials both print and online.

BBBS offers a variety of mentoring programs to meet the needs of the children and families in the community and to accommodate the schedules of the volunteers we rely on to build quality mentoring relationships.  Our CARES (Creating Access to Resources, Events & Services) Program provides resources, basic needs, and recreational/educational activities to youth who are waiting to be matched, Matches, and families.

The underserved youth who enroll in our programs are growing up in two of the poorest counties in NJ. Both areas score alarmingly low in Kids Count & Public Health Rankings surveys (Annie. E. Casey Foundation, County Health Rankings). Cumberland County has a 15.3% poverty rate, which is 25% higher than the national average, while Salem County's poverty rate is 10% higher than the NJ state's rate.

The GCHA's mission is to empower all local communities in Greenbrier County to improve health through community action and innovative programming.An Alliance core planning group began meeting monthly in October 2014 to develop a shared process for networking collaboratively to define issues and consensus on intervention activities.  The group agreed that interventions would intend to improve health and well-being of country residents by focusing on 4 major action areas: socioeconomic factors, physical environment, health behaviors and clinical partnerships.
Simultaneously, the planning group developed an organizational structure to become a non-profit organization and received non-profit designation in November 2015.  A newly established board of directors and 4 task force work plans have been defined to: (1) Expand the community ambassador program; (2) Increase capacity and create a network of supports to sustain evidence based self-management community workshops; (3) Develop a digital asset map of county health resources; (4) and Aggregate local foods to help meet local needs.
A key component to the Alliance coordinated approach for the community health outreach is the use of community ambassadors.  Ambassadors are identified because they have an interest in improving their communities’ health.  In 2015, five communities participated by identifying local ambassadors who became trained to identify a local need and implement a mini-grant project.

Dreamcatchers students have the advantage with access to 360 degrees of support We collaborate with teachers, school administrators, guidance counselors and principals. When school is not in session students in our program will become involved in civic projects. Summer of 2024 our focus is agricultural and culinary inventiveness. Learning how to garden, grow, and cook from experts. Program participants travel to other parts of Maine and New England and the world, visiting college campuses along the way. We will engage in a variety of outdoor activities, including camping, skiing, and canoe trips. Most importantly is learning to be part of a community and developing powerful new relationships. Our goal is for program participants to form relationships with their adult mentors and other students involved in the program – people outside of their immediate family and social circle with whom they otherwise might never connect. Through these shared experiences and relationships over their six-years in the Dreamcatchers program participants develop the confidence to take on new challenges and dream bigger dreams.

PCCE- Wilkes University VISTA,"The Y2 project will focus on food access and food security across campus at Wilkes University. As our project continues into its second year the mission also moves forward. A main priority will always be to reduce the stigma around seeking food assistance. In Y2, with the PA Hunger Free Campus Designation Application submitted, the focus will now turn towards leveraging that distinction in our work: applying for grants, creating sustainable avenues of funding for the work we do, creating SNAP resources for our campus community. Currently, there are no clear processes or procedures in place if a student needs assistance or support accessing off-campus resources, such as SNAP. There is no clear place on campus where a student can stop by to receive knowledgeable support in this area. This project would look to further the development of the food pantry on campus through marketing, access, available goods, and funding. This project would also seek to create a known space on campus where students can come to ask questions, find out what options they have (on and off campus), and how they can move forward with those options. Our partner agency, CEO/Weinberg Northeast Regional Foodbank has consistently supported our work for the last four years and remains committed to bettering the lives of our students. They have allowed us to serve nearly 90 students a month during the school year in The Colonel’s Cupboard. A large portion of our traditional, full-time, student body falls in the low to very low income range, which further indicates that this is a needed resource on campus. A VISTA member can be a part of this solution by providing full-time attention to the project and bringing about clear and dramatic change while ensuring we maintain compliance with state standards for the Hunger-Free Campus Designation. As a university, it is time we invested in a project that benefits the well-being of our students beyond the classroom.

In Y2 the VISTA will be tasked with continued outreach and data collection to ensure our food pantry is meeting the needs of our campus community.

This includes working with the grant office, institutional research, as well as marketing to ensure the state designation is leveraged to its fullest potential. Ideally, the Y2 VISTA would be able to start research to create a Wilkes-specific SNAP guide that could be shared with students, staff and faculty even after this project is completed. Using data from the first 2 years, the Y3 VISTA would then be able to work on material development as well as developing and facilitating trainings and maximize existing resources for sustainability.","Childcare assistance if eligible , Choice of Education Award or End of Service Stipend , Living Allowance , Training , Education award upon successful completion of service , Relocation Allowance , Stipend , On Campus resources and facilities , Housing , Health Coverage* .","Permits working at another job during off hours , Permits attendance at school during off hours , Car recommended .","['Health', 'Community and Economic Development', 'Education', 'Hunger']","['Writing/Editing', 'Public Health', 'Education', 'Team Work', 'Community Organization', 'Fund raising/Grant Writing', 'General Skills', 'Social Services', 'Non-Profit Management', 'Leadership']",['AmeriCorps VISTA'],08/25/2025,08/24/2026,['Full Time'],Associates degree (AA),18,None,,From  06/10/2025  To  08/25/2025,06/10/2025,08/25/2025,"Lucio Perez Perez

VHA - Lighthouse Land Trust Communications VISTA,"Virginia Housing Alliance’s (VHA) AmeriCorps VISTA project is a statewide intermediary project with 18 Host Sites, all that either work to expand affordable housing opportunities and/or end homelessness throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. VHA’s VISTA project aims to develop viable communities by promoting integrated approaches that provide decent housing, suitable living environments, and expansive economic opportunities for low and moderate-income persons. This listing is to fill the Host Site opening for an emerging CLT called Lighthouse Beloved Community located in Lynchburg, VA.

The FARRR Foundation, Inc., affectionately known as ""The Lighthouse"" was established in 2004 by a first-generation Asian-American. At the core of this work is the evidence-based wraparound approach to demonstrate that within the concept of a trauma-resilient community healing occurs. 

Many of the families that receive services at The Lighthouse live in the formerly red-lined 24501 zip-code. Individuals are medically marginalized and trapped living in unsafe, decaying homes built in the 1930's era. Over the past three years, 90 acres of land has been acquired in this district and the land is deeded into a Community Land Trust (CLT). Lighthouse Beloved Community Land Trust (LBC CLT) will offer affordable ownership of new sustainable, energy efficient housing. No other program exists in the City of Lynchburg that preserves the affordability of home ownership and promotes the wraparound reach that The Lighthouse delivers.

FARRR Lighthouse is looking for a detail-oriented individual to serve as the Lighthouse Beloved Community CLT Communications Strategist VISTA with the goal of increasing the awareness of the newly established CLT by developing outreach campaigns, creating surveys to involve the community in decision making processes, and expanding capacity by implementing more efficient systems and procedures.

Community Impact Lead I,"Did you know that nationally, over half of all students who begin at a community college, do not complete? The Mentoring Project provides support to low-income college students to stay enrolled and finish their degree. This is done by providing 1:1 community volunteer mentors. The Mentor provides guidance to the student in overcoming obstacles to graduation and/or career advising. In addition, TMP provides virtual career panels that are available free to Washington students.  Student served by The Mentoring Project are enrolled on various Washington campuses and all meetings with mentors occur virtually, not at the campus or any other physical site. 

We rely on our community college partner institutions to refer students.   However, more tactical outreach is now required, such as a peer-recruit/referral network. Although most of our outreach is conducted electronically, we will visit some campuses to post flyers and table at events to inform students about mentorship opportunities.   

The community colleges are the postsecondary sector with the least resources, the largest population of low-income students and students of color, and the highest level of attrition. This project addresses the fact that only slightly more than half of students who begin a degree at one of the community or technical colleges in Washington state will graduate (53% in 2019; 54% in 2020; 57% in 2021). [Source: Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges]. The attrition rate is higher for historically underserved students of color who may have difficulty connecting to services and building or finding caring relationships on campus.

PCCE – Community & Campus Leader Empowerment Advocate VISTA,"Supportive Partnerships for Youth (SPY) is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children in the greater Carlisle area learn and grow academically, socially, and emotionally. We provide year-round, free educational enrichment programming to children from low-income homes who are struggling in the classroom. We advance the future for those most often left behind and in doing so, address a root cause of poverty. For the last 38 years, SPY's capacity has been limited to serving students of elementary-ages, however, there is a growing, critical need in our community for accessible programs that address the similar needs of vulnerable middle-school aged students. The VISTA member will help establish the framework and foundation of a SPY Counselor-In-Training (CIT) program aimed at the identity and personal development needs of middle-school aged children.

At Dickinson, the Center for Civic Learning and Action (CCLA) seeks to nurture ethical civic leaders who collaborate in the pursuit of stronger communities. The CCLA prioritizes community engagement through equal attention to student education, community development, and academic engagement. Our two organizations are aligned in mission given our investment in addressing community needs through education, our shared attention to partnering with the local Carlisle community, and our capacity-building efforts to institutionalize more robust student empowerment programs to meet community-identified projects. 

At the CCLA, we have found an overwhelming number of community organizations who have needs that are not being met, particularly related to direct service, which Dickinson College has the capacity to meet, given a large number of interested participants, but not the infrastructure to make these connections efficient and streamlined.

EngageCorps VISTA at Kean University,"At Kean University, our mission in the Office of Career Services is to provide students, particularly first-generation and historically underserved populations, with the tools and support necessary to transition successfully from college into meaningful careers. Our Career Services department plays a pivotal role in that mission by working to reduce underemployment and unemployment among recent graduates, key contributors to poverty in our community.
Research shows that employers believe recent college graduates are not adequately prepared for the workforce. This preparedness gap is particularly detrimental to low-income and first-generation students who may lack the networks, resources, and confidence to access high-quality employment opportunities. As a result, they are more vulnerable to cycles of economic insecurity.

They will collect and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data to inform a set of actionable recommendations, support targeted outreach campaigns, and contribute to the design of new programming and partnerships. Their efforts will directly support students in securing employment aligned with their degrees, ultimately increasing social mobility and reducing poverty across the student population and surrounding communities.

AmeriCorps ACCESS Project,"The ACCESS program, based at UNC Greensboro’s Center for New North Carolinians, places AmeriCorps members with local nonprofits to support immigrant and refugee families in employment, integration, and education.

With employment, members assist individuals with creating resumes, applying for jobs, preparing for interviews through mock sessions, and understanding workplace culture and expectations. They also offer employment-related case management, helping clients build the skills and confidence to secure and retain jobs.

Integration services typically include case management, assistance with obtaining IDs, navigating public transportation, accessing health and human services, learning English, and other wraparound services. Members also respond to emerging needs to help immigrants and refugees successfully integrate into their new communities.

As for education, members support K–12 students with homework help and other academic needs at the after-school programs. They engage parents to become active participants in their children’s education and help recruit volunteers to strengthen the overall support network. They also coordinate enrichment activities during the summer, including field trips and other educational programming.

Members receive professional development on a variety of topics, including Cultural Awareness, Professional Interpretation, and Immigration Law, among others. They also receive support throughout their term from the program staff and their site supervisors. Members typically exit the program with valuable personal and professional growth, along with transferable skills that can be applied to future careers and education.

BMVP - Sustainable Food Security Solutions for Youth,"Tumbleweed provides safety, assistance, and hope to our community’s vulnerable and homeless youth, creating lasting life changes.
In total, the Billings area currently has over 800 homeless youth and young adults. From 2020-2023, the number of homeless students enrolled in Billings schools rose from 457 to 567. Last year, Tumbleweed fed over 18,000 homeless youth and young adults through their food pantry program. On average, the organization’s Drop-In Resource Centers have anywhere between 30 to 60 youth who receive breakfast, lunch, and food box services daily. The mission to alleviate hunger and increase access to nutritious food for low-income community members, especially youth, continues to grow.
A holistic approach to community well-being includes targeting health-related needs. By ensuring access to nutritious food and health education opportunities, we can positively impact both the physical and mental well-being of our youth, thereby alleviating the overall burden on healthcare systems. Promoting lifelong learning and skill development, enhancing employability, and empowering young adults to contribute meaningfully to society is essential to reduce the effects of poverty. Successfully meeting community needs also fosters a sense of pride and engagement. Positive changes and improvements inspire young adults to actively participate in the growth and development of their community.
This project will alleviate poverty by increasing access to low-cost, fresh produce; providing alternative food distribution opportunities for youth in need; and offering educational opportunities that increase health knowledge. Meeting these needs and improving health knowledge will influence youth to implement healthy choices that lead to better health outcomes and more financial stability throughout their lives.

EngageCorps VISTA at El Pueblo Unido of Atlantic City,"El Pueblo Unido of Atlantic City is a grassroots, immigrant-led nonprofit working to empower Latino and immigrant communities across Atlantic County through legal services, social services,  transformative education, and community organizing. Our mission is to ensure that working-class immigrant families, workers,
tenants, and youth have the tools and power to thrive with dignity and justice. We are building a future where immigrant communities are supported, organized, and leading.
In 2025, we opened our first-ever community center, expanded Know Your Rights workshops to four cities,
and helped hundreds of families overcome barriers to housing, healthcare, and economic opportunity. We’re taking the next step by launching a bilingual countywide Community Needs Assessment and supporting a Latino student-led civic engagement campaign—both happening simultaneously.
Our community faces intersecting challenges: unaffordable housing, unsafe working conditions, language and legal barriers, fear of deportation, and exclusion from public services. Yet there is little formal data reflecting these realities, and few spaces where young people can organize to change them.
An EngageCorps VISTA will play a key role in both efforts. They will support the rollout of the community
needs assessment while also working alongside Latino student organizations to build a coalition focused on
voter education, policy advocacy, and public campaigns that address housing, health, and economic justice.

Goodwill VISTA* Best Buddies Community Outreach VISTA,"Best Buddies aims to eradicate the social, emotional, and economic disparities of those with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Our programs are based upon our belief that people with disabilities have the capacity to be loyal friends, strong community leaders, and valued citizens. People with IDD can and should be integrated seamlessly into the fabric of the communities in which they live - yet often they are separated from the rest of the population with few opportunities to make friendships and the long-term consequences of such exclusion are devastating. People with IDD face even greater economic challenges. Mainers with IDD live in poverty at nearly twice the rate of Mainers without IDD. Best Buddies aims to address this inequity through inclusive friendships, leadership opportunities, and employment programs that empower individuals with IDD to build social connections, develop skills, and access meaningful opportunities. By creating a more inclusive community we work to break down barriers to social and economic participation, helping individuals with IDD lead fulfilling and independent lives. The Best Buddies Citizens program works with individuals 18+, meeting a crucial need within our community as many adults with IDD have limited opportunities to further their education beyond high school and may have difficulty securing employment, limiting their social circle. Through the Citizens program, adults with IDD have the opportunity to make meaningful connections in their communities. While establishing one-to-one friendships between adults with and without IDD is a main goal of this program, Best Buddies Citizens also works to build community amongst our members. This is achieved through offering a variety of social activities throughout the year and engaging members in state events and local stewardship efforts. The power of our programs lies in its simplicity: everyone does better with a friend. Visit www.bestbuddies.org.maine to learn more.

First is the improvement and growth of our Citizens Chapters through strategies aimed at increasing our member recruitment (individuals who volunteer with our program become members of Best Buddies); processing applications which includes running background checks on potential members, interviewing potential members, finding matches for those members interested, regularly checking in on members for satisfaction and program involvement, and planning/hosting events throughout the year. The second is the organization of a yearlong stewardship calendar that engages new community partners while also maintaining and strengthening current connections through community outreach and communication strategies including but not limited to community tabling, stewardship emails, and communications.","Living Allowance , Health Coverage* , Relocation Allowance , Childcare assistance if eligible , Choice of Education Award or End of Service Stipend , Training .","Car recommended , Permits working at another job during off hours , Permits attendance at school during off hours .",['Community Outreach'],"['Communications', 'Public Speaking', 'Team Work', 'Community Organization', 'General Skills']",['AmeriCorps VISTA'],06/02/2025,06/01/2026,['Full Time'],,18,None,,From  03/10/2025  To  03/09/2026,03/10/2025,03/09/2026,"Sarah Ward

Many residents face barriers to homeownership due to low wages and a deficit in quality housing.  DNDC’s approach focuses on rehabilitating existing homes to extend their usability, offer cost-effective, high-quality homeownership options, and maintain the integrity of middle neighborhoods as viable communities for the growing workforce. DNDC is seeking a detail-oriented, organized self-starter with strong skills in time management to serve as the Housing Specialist VISTA member, who will play a key role in advancing DNDC’s mission by strengthening and expanding its home repair and rehabilitation program.

To work towards our mission, “Nourishing minds and bodies; Empowering families and communities,” we work in collaboration with social and human service organizations, the Trenton School District, and medical health resources to ensure that families of all ages and stages can access the services they need to live a more fulfilling life. We provide a range of integrated services that build community, nurture self-worth and independence, and offer resources for children, families, and communities to overcome poverty and its lasting effects. As the founder and leader of the Mercer County Community School Initiative, a key component of our work is done in partnership with three Trenton Public Schools- Rivera Elementary School, Gregory Elementary School, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr Middle School. Through this model, we have the opportunity to touch children and families affected by poverty and community trauma in a central location with more resources than can be offered through a singular agency. Our newly launched School-Based Food Pantries are an extension of this initiative. The program was designed in response to challenges that our families face regarding food security, which were intensified during/after the COVID-19 pandemic. As a Food Pantry VISTA, you will lead food distribution at our three choice pantries. During food distribution, you will build relationships with families and community members, providing the opportunity to connect with them on a deeper level and inquire about additional support that may be needed. Serving as a connector to community-based services, you will provide support that empowers the whole family, including career services, housing support, mental health service referrals, and more.

Our goal is for our pantries to become hubs for the community, offering case management services, computer labs, print/copy/fax services, SNAP application assistance, and more. The centers should offer additional services that could be required for families to combat poverty and its long-term effects. In addition to leading food distribution at our three choice pantries, you will help develop and manage additional family resource center services. You will also build relationships with families and community members, identifying additional needs that may exist to support the whole family. Based on these needs, you will provide basic case management, serving as a connector to community-based services, you will provide referrals for the whole family, including career services, housing support, mental health services, etc.","Education award upon successful completion of service , Choice of Education Award or End of Service Stipend , Living Allowance , Relocation Allowance , Stipend , Health Coverage* , Childcare assistance if eligible , Training .","Permits working at another job during off hours , Permits attendance at school during off hours .",['Hunger'],"['Social Services', 'General Skills', 'Public Health', 'Team Work', 'Leadership', 'Community Organization', 'Conflict Resolution']",['AmeriCorps VISTA'],08/26/2025,08/22/2026,['Full Time'],College graduate,18,None,['English'],From  04/22/2025  To  12/05/2025,04/22/2025,12/05/2025,"Saul Petersen

High Rocks Greenbrier County Health Alliance Partnership,"The Greenbrier County Health alliance (GCHA) is sponsored by the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine, Center for Rural and Community Health with grant funding from West Virginia Clinical Translational Science Institute.  The GCHA's mission is to empower all local communities in Greenbrier County to improve health through community action and innovative programming. 

An Alliance core planning group began meeting monthly in October 2014 to develop a shared process for networking collaboratively to define issues and consensus on intervention activities.  The group agreed that interventions would intend to improve health and well-being of country residents by focusing on 4 major action areas: socioeconomic factors, physical environment, health behaviors and clinical partnerships. 

Simultaneously, the planning group developed an organizational structure to become a non-profit organization and received non-profit designation in November 2015.  A newly established board of directors and 4 task force work plans have been defined to: (1) Expand the community ambassador program; (2) Increase capacity and create a network of supports to sustain evidence based self-management community workshops; (3) Develop a digital asset map of county health resources; (4) and Aggregate local foods to help meet local needs. 

A key component to the Alliance coordinated approach for the community health outreach is the use of community ambassadors.  Ambassadors are identified because they have an interest in improving their communities’ health.  In 2015, five communities participated by identifying local ambassadors who became trained to identify a local need and implement a mini-grant project.  Mini-grant projects occurred across the county and these help define pathways for future coordination of grassroots engagement.

Kids in Tech Fundraising and Development VISTA,"Kids in Tech, Inc’s (KIT’s) mission is to excite, educate, and empower children to acquire skills and confidence in technology through interactive after school programs. The existing STEM educational framework does few favors for low-income children, who statistically tend to live in urban or suburban settings and be ethnic minorities. Without targeted interventions that promote STEM education for low-income and BIPOC students, their interests and potential will remain untapped. After-school STEM programs have provided evidence that, even in specialized curriculum settings, children who qualify for lunch subsidies scored lower than their counterparts who did not qualify. Elementary and middle school aged children in these programs did see improvements to their outcomes, and under-privileged groups saw the greatest gains. After-school STEM programs have demonstrated a unique learning environment that enables group-centered and hands-on-learning that make demonstrable gains in knowledge acquisition.

KIT’s after school programs have been a vital supplemental opportunity for low-income youth in Lowell schools and housing authority for the past 8 years, and expanded to serve students in Boston in 2021. Performance in STEM areas for these groups remains low in Lowell, Boston, and nationally. Thus, it is critical that after school STEM programs are able to expand to meet the needs of as more students require support and time to provide remedial education. KIT’s VISTA project will seek to prepare KIT to serve more low-income, minority students in Massachusetts by increasing the organization’s fundraising, communications, curricula, fundraising, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and expects to benefit 300 youth aged 8 to 14 from schools where at least 50% of students qualify for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).

Goodwill VISTA* Washington County Music Program Coordinator,"Maine Academy of Modern Music (MAMM) is a community-led, non-profit school of music that started in 2007. Serving as Maine’s own “school of rock” MAMM offers classes, lessons, camps, and ensemble experiences in contemporary genres. MAMM serves all ages with a primary focus on youth ages 8 to 18, especially those struggling at home or in school due to language, cultural, social, learning, and/or income barriers. MAMM’s headquarters are in Portland but its programming extends statewide. 

This position is based in western Washington County, where one-third of families live in poverty and youth report feeling sad or hopeless at significantly higher rates than their peers elsewhere in the state. The toxic stress of generational poverty harms developing youth and undermines well-being into adulthood. However, high quality arts programming of the sort MAMM provides both in school and after school has been shown to cultivate resilience and mitigate the negative effects of toxic stress. Youth who develop resilience are better able to learn, grow, and thrive into adulthood, and MAMM helps them do exactly that. 

MAMM’s partner sites–schools and after school programs–have struggled to provide music education and enrichment for years. Our partners need and want more music education and enrichment offerings. They understand the important role music plays in cultivating resilient youth, but no one organization has the capacity to offer these opportunities on their own. By facilitating collaboration and developing innovative program models to meet youth where they are, MAMM fills a critical need in Washington County’s educational and artistic ecosystems.

These connections will help the public defenders to more effectively provide wraparound services to their clients and to more clearly understand and communicate the overall local services landscape upon which their clients rely.

OV students are empowered with the knowledge, skills, and attributes needed to be successful and contributing citizens of a global society by way of the resources invested by the communities. In other words, OV’s mission is to prepare students to be ready to take on the challenges of the world once they graduate. OV offers a variety of programming, from college prep courses to outdoor education, theater, and Tech Ed. However, even with historically strong community support, we lack cohesion in connecting our students with opportunities that directly prepare them for what is to come after graduation. Even with options for students to partake in career preparation courses, hands-on options at both the school and local CTE centers, internships, and work-based learning, there is still more work to be done. OV is a key support in the lives of many of our students. As a smaller rural district we are integral to the daily support of many of our students, working to alleviate the issues that come along with poverty. No place is this seen as in our student's lunch program with 42% of our students would qualify for free and reduced lunch. Along with this, OV works to meet the needs of our students in many other ways. We offer college planning resources, work-based learning, after-school activities and transportation to and from school. These are tools that we use to work to break the cycles of poverty to help our students turn their focus to their education which in turn will lead to them pursuing post-graduate opportunities such as apprenticeship, college, technical school and the military. This will lead OV graduates to high-wage, high-growth jobs through these supports so as to ultimately disrupt generational poverty and provide a bright future.

EngageCorps VISTA at the Petey Greene Program,"The Petey Greene Program supports the academic and career goals of incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people through high-quality tutoring and other educational programs, while serving to educate our volunteers and the public on the manifest injustice in our carceral system. We focus on a critical gap predominant among system impacted people: the lack of access to educational and career pathways to find a job and achieve economic mobility. Formerly incarcerated people are nearly twice as likely to have no high school credential, and eight times less likely to complete college (Couloute 2018). This has economic effects: those with less than a high school diploma earn nearly 53% less than their college-educated peers (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2024). These disparities put formerly incarcerated people at a significant disadvantage: 65% of returning citizens experience joblessness within 4 years after release (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2010) and those who find employment typically receive an income below the poverty line (Looney and Turner 2018). We provide access to individualized programs that help our students make progress towards a degree or career. Our curricula made an impact: in Fall of 2024, tutors reported 89% of our students met their goals in sessions, and 93% of students with at least 2 months of sessions said they progressed towards their goals. 

Working with Americorps plays a major role in helping to make our mission possible. The model is an ideal fit for a deeply mission-driven, rapidly-evolving organization like the PGP.

BMVP - Improve Programs to Help Victims of Domestic Violence,"The Friendship Center (TFC) provides a safe haven for those affected by domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, empowering their community to flourish in relationships free from violence. Data from the Montana Board of Crime Control (MBCC) Statistical Analysis Center shows that domestic violence remains one of the most frequently reported crimes in Montana: There were 628 Partner and Family Member Assaults in TFC’s tri-county service area throughout 2023, including 14 kidnappings and 72 sex offenses reported. Because they are the only local organization offering these services, TFC serves twice as many survivors as the average domestic violence agency in Montana, assisting more than 700 individuals annually compared to the state average of 354. Domestic violence often has long-term physical and mental health impacts, with the National Health Institute sharing in one study that women suspected of being victims of Intimate Partner Violence have more health problems than the general population, including 2.7 times higher rates of anxiety disorders and 2.2 times higher rates of major psychiatric disorders. This project will alleviate poverty by addressing the economic barriers that often trap individuals in cycles of abuse. Low to no income individuals in domestic violence situations rarely have the resources needed to break free from violence. Abusers frequently exert economic control by restricting access to finances, employment opportunities, transportation, and vital documentation. By increasing TFC’s capacity to provide support services through a strong volunteer base, TFC will be able to not only provide immediate relief, but create pathways for survivors to gain financial independence and stability.

BMVP - Housing for Everyone to Support Crime Reduction,"Alternatives, Inc. has the mission to “challenge offenders to become responsible, productive citizens through firm, fair, and consistent supervision, treatment, and education.” In Montana’s largest city, Billings, there are approximately 3,000 offenders on probation and parole and another 500 living in community corrections residential programs. While affordable housing opportunities are limited with over 80% of low-income households paying more than 30-50% of their income for housing costs, being an offender provides an additional set of barriers for individuals and families. The City’s Citizen Survey noted that the need for public safety is a major concern and this project works to address this non-housing issue by ensuring that housing is an opportunity for offenders releasing to the community. When landlords understand the benefits and wrap around services that offenders engaged in programming receive, they are more likely to rent to offenders. When offenders have access to safe and stable housing, they are less likely to offend. Safe and stable housing improves one’s ability to retain gainful employment. This project will alleviate poverty by increasing access to housing, thus reducing the risk of reoffending, and improving their ability to secure and maintain employment, thus ending the cycle of poverty.
